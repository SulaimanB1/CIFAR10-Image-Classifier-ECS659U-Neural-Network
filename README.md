CIFAR-10 Image Classifier â€“ ECS659U Neural Networks

This repository contains a *CIFAR-10* *Image Classification project* implemented using neural networks in *Python*, developed as part of laboratory work for the ECS659U Neural Networks module at Queen Mary University of London.

The project demonstrates the design, training, and evaluation of a deep learning model to classify images from the *CIFAR-10 dataset* (10 categories of common objects such as airplanes, cars, cats, and dogs).

Features
Neural Network architecture built with *PyTorch*.
Training and evaluation pipeline with accuracy/loss tracking.
Support for GPU acceleration (CUDA) if available.
Experiments with hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and optimizers.
Visualization of training curves and model performance.
Dataset handling and preprocessing (normalization, augmentation).
